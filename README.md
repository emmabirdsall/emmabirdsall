Hi, I'm Emma Birdsall!

I'm switching careers into front end development after working in the legal field for the past 7 years. 
I really want to be a part of an ever-changing and developing industry and I'm looking for a great company
who will believe in me.

I completed a certificate program all while working full-time so I know I can learn anything.
I have a positive attitude and a desire to learn.

Thanks for looking at my code! Even if it's not being updated daily, I am coding daily and working
towards my next project. 

Visit my portfolio site www.simplyemmabirdsall.com to find out more about me.

Thank you!
